    <p>Imagine the following situations:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>John decided to open a company. He invested $20,000 to buy raw materials. In the first month of
            operation, he used $5,000 worth of raw materials and had $25,000 of total sales, he also has
            $10,000 of bills to pay.</li>
        <li>You own a computer that is worth $5,000 if you sell it today. You bought it for $7,500 and paid
            $4,000 so far. Apart from that, you have $2,000 in your checkings account and $1,500 of bills to be
            paid.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Assets and Liabilities</h2>
    <p>All persons and companies usually own some stuff and also owe some stuff.</p>
    <p>In accounting, all the stuff we own are called "assets", and all the stuff we owe are called
        "liabilities".</p>
    <p>In the first example above, John's company has $40,000 worth of assets and $40,000 worth of liabilities.
        In the second example, you would have $7,000 worth of assets and $7,000 worth of liabilities. Yeah, I
        know, it doesn't make sense yet, but I'll explain it.</p>
    <h2>The Accounting Equation</h2>
    <p>In the world of accounting, everything must be in balance. Imagine accounting as an old scale where both
        sides must always be at the same height.</p>
    <p>This balance is represented by the accounting equation:</p>
    <p class="board">Assets = Liabilities + Equity</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/images/accounting-scale.jpg" alt="old scale" width="500" />
        <figcaption>In accounting, everything must always be in balance</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>For a company, the equity represents how much the company owes to the shareholders, and for a person, it
        represents how much money you actually have.</p>
    <p>Sometimes we can find the equation expressed a little bit differently, but in the end it still represents
        the same concept: "Equity = Assets - Liabilities", which makes sense because it basically means that
        your equity is everything you own subtracted by everything you owe.</p>
    <p>Now that we know that the accounting equation demands balance, let's get back to the examples and
        demonstrate them as code. Remember that the point here is to explain the concepts, so please don't mind
        the Asset and Liability classes adding nothing to the parent class' behavior.</p>
    <div class="codeblock--filename">src/asset_liability.ts</div>
    <pre class="codeblock--source"><code class="language-typescript">import type { MoneyFacade } from "./money";
import money from "./money";

export abstract class Priceable {
    constructor(private _name: string, private _value: MoneyFacade) {}

    get name() {
        return this._name;
    }

    get value() {
        return this._value;
    }
}

// An asset is something priceable
export class Asset extends Priceable {
    constructor(name: string, value: MoneyFacade) {
        super(name, value);
    }
}

// so is a liability
export class Liability extends Priceable {
    constructor(name: string, value: MoneyFacade) {
        super(name, value);
    }
}

export function sum(items: Priceable[]) {
    return items.reduce((total, item) => {
        return total.add(item.value);
    }, money("BRL", 0));
